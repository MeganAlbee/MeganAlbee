## 👋 Hi, I’m @MeganAlbee 
My goal in data science is to use my comprehensive knowledge of data, algorithms, and analytics to generate valuable insights and solutions. I am currently finishing my Masters of Science in Business Analytics from the University of Montana. In this program we tackle real-world business challenges and solve them with data science. 

✏️ With a background in journalism from Cal Poly SLO, I found a path in data science where I bring together communication skills and analytics. Additionally, I have other minors in global politics and media arts, society and technology. 

🔪 Skills in Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and AWS  

  - Machine Learning 

  - Data Pipelines
