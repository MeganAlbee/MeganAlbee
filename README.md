## 👋 Hi, I’m @MeganAlbee 
I am passionate about learning about all things data analytics and growing my skillset through hands-on learning projects. I am currently working on showcasing a range of data projects, from working with a local homeless shelter to discover impacts on the length of stay and a product experience analytics project for a sizeable Missoula-based map application. 

- 🌱 Growing my skills in Pyth, SQL, R, Tableau, AWS, and more!  

- 👀 I’m interested in finding an internship in data science & analytics!
